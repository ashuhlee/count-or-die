## Core Gameplay
- Increase your count to match the current goal before the timer expires
- Each goal reached increases the timer speed
- Can't click fast enough? Boosts can jump you to the goal (up to 4 times per game)

| `Escape`            | Restart game     |
| Mouse click         | App interactions |
